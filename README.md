# Guide-Bot-System-For-Web-Crawler
A repository of making a draft / ideas for a guide bot system for web crawler for coordination, navigation, evaluation and filtering of web site during web graph traversal.

I started off with my idea I got while riding on a bus and looking for signs to see where I was in the dark evening. I noticed that I could get a general location by looking at a distant billboard, which is familiar to me. 

This gave me an inspiration for having web crawler to have a guide bot that will use MCP (in two definitions, Master Control Progam and Model Context Protocol (more common nowadays)).
Please feel free to expand on this idea and make it a standard for the future of web crawlers and its coordination through MCP by it being used by AI Agents and web crawlers.
